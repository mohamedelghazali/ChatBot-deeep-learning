# ChatBot-deeep-learning
In this repository we will see how to build a deep learning model for a chatbot

All of the necessary components to run this project are on this GitHub repository ; 

1_`chatbot.py`  `the code for reading in the natural language data into a training set and using a Keras sequential neural network to create a model`

2_`GUI.py` `the code for cleaning up the responses based on the predictions from the model and creating a graphical interface for interacting with the chatbot`

3_`classes.pkl` `a list of different types of classes of responses`

4_`words.pkl ` `a list of different words that could be used for pattern recognition`

5_`intents.json `` abunch of JavaScript objects that lists different tags that correspond to different types of word patterns`

6_`chatbot_model.h5 `` the actual model created by train_chatbot.py and used by chatgui.py`
